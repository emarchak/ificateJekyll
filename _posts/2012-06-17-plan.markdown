As of now, there are a few things I'd like to do with this site. I expect to expand on them in the future, but here's a list:

* Set up site on ificate.net.
* Script pushing to ificate.net from home server.
* Include CC-BY-SA junk.
* Consider/add prettyPhoto for photo sharing.
* Use github push hooks to autopublish to ificate.net.
* Tweak site design.
* RSS feeds by tag/category.
* Consider external hosting for larger content.
* Provide a stream for all articles I've read. Bookmarklet? Does Google RSS work with this?
* Hook stream into Cosm?
